a. Delete all lines containing word software and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file. (Please be aware of case sensitivity)

b. Replace all occurrence of word and to them and save results in /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt file.

Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter any words containing this string; for example upto, contributor etc.

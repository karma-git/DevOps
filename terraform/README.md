Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v3.40.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v3.40.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

## Check changes

$ tf plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```
## TF apply

...
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.my_ubuntu: Creating...
aws_instance.my_ubuntu: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.my_ubuntu: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.my_ubuntu: Creation complete after 27s [id=<my_fresh_instace_id>]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
## terraform.tfstate
Find public ip of the ec2 `ip4=$(egrep -o '"public_ip": "(.+?)"' terraform.tfstate | egrep -o "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}")`
! NOTE:
If you run $ tf apply again, it won't create a new instance, but if you will delete terraform.tfstate and than exec $ tf apply a new instance will be created.
